This is the more structured and beautified code.
This application has been coded in AngularJS platform along with Cordova for hybrid application platforms. The previously uploaded directory,
has the basic code that totally works on JavaScript. This application directory is a successor to  "via_JavaScript" directory in this same project,
which is only uploaded for the basic knowledge and understanding of how the JavaScript SDK of facebook GraphAPI works.

This application follows the MVC structure and thus I have put all the API calls in the "factory.js" file under "js/" directory.
The API calls return data to the controller in the form of deferred promises or rejects.
